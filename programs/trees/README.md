# Tree Notes

## Binary Tree

It has at most two  2 child at a time.

Tree traversal
1. Depth first Search 

		It has three type : 
		1 InOrder :  Left Root Right	
		2 PreOrder:  Root Left Right
		3 PostOrder:  Left Right Root

		All the three has Time complexity  = O(n), where  n is equal to number of nodes
		All the thee has space complexity =  O(h) where h is equal to height of the tree
